    "Science has traditionally been divided into experimental and theoretical disciplines, but during the last several decades computing has emerged as a very important part of science. Scientific computing is often closely related to theory, but it also has many characteristics in common with experimental work. It is therefore often viewed as a new third branch of science. In most fields of science, computational work is an important complement to both experiments and theory, and nowadays a vast majority of both experimental and theoretical papers involve some numerical calculations, simulations or computer modeling.\n",

    "In experimental and theoretical sciences there are well established codes of conducts for how results and methods are published and made available to other scientists. For example, in theoretical sciences, derivations, proofs and other results are published in full detail, or made available upon request. Likewise, in experimental sciences, the methods used and the results are published, and all experimental data should be available upon request. It is considered unscientific to withhold crucial details in a theoretical proof or experimental method, that would hinder other scientists from replicating and reproducing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational sciences there are not yet any well established guidelines for how source code and generated data should be handled. For example, it is relatively rare that source code used in simulations for published papers are provided to readers, in contrast to the open nature of experimental and theoretical work. And it is not uncommon that source code for simulation software is withheld and considered a competitive advantage (or unnecessary to publish). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this issue has recently started to attract increasing attention, and a number of editorials in high-profile journals have called for increased openness in computational sciences. Some prestigious journals, including Science, have even started to demand of authors to provide the source code for simulation software used in publications to readers upon request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discussions are also ongoing on how to facilitate distribution of scientific software, for example as supplementary materials to scientific papers."

    "* Replication: An author of a scientific paper that involves numerical calculations should be able to rerun the simulations and replicate the results upon request. Other scientist should also be able to perform the same calculations and obtain the same results, given the information about the methods used in a publication.\n",

    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "* **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs. \n",
    "* **interpreted:** No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",

    "Advantages:\n",

    "* The main advantage is ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourages many good programming practices:\n",
    " * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
